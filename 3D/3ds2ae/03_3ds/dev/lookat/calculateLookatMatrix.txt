OK, I'll brief you on how calculateLookAtMatrix() generates a matrix to
make an object look at something...

Firstly, how a matrix works...

A MAX matrix consists of 3 rows, that represent the X axis, Y axis, Z
axis, and location respectively.  Each row is a point3 vector.

The first row indicates where in 3D space the object's X axis will point.
The second row indicates where in 3D space the object's Y axis will point.
The third row indicates where in 3D space the object's Z axis will point.
The fourth row indicates where in 3D space the object's origin will be
located.  You can easily test this last point by changing
obj.transform.row4 to be a location on space.

The identity matrix is:

   X Y Z
  [1,0,0]  X axis
  [0,1,0]  Y axis
  [0,0,1]  Z axis
  [0,0,0]  origin

The labels show that the object's X axis points along the world's X axis
(X axis row is [1,0,0]).  The same is true for Y and Z axis.  The origin
is at [0,0,0], which places the object's origin at the world's origin.


So, how do you generate a useful matrix to point something somewhere?

Firstly, I recommend you play with an object by rotating it a little, then
having a look at its transformation matrix, and note how the first three
rows correspond to where the axis handles are located in the view.

Note the following useful properties about a normal transformation matrix: 

  * The axis vectors are one unit long (unless the object is scaled).
  * The axis vectors are all at right angles to one another.

Hold your right hand palm-up with your fingers all pointing forward.
Extend your thumb to the right, keep your index finger pointing forwards,
point your middle finger up, and curl up your ring and little fingers.
Your thumb is X, index is Y, and middle finger is Z.  This orientation of
axis is known as the "right hand rule".  Do the same with your left hand,
and the same axis mapping to fingers creates the left hand rule.  Note
that when you hold your left hand with palm down, X and Y are the same,
but Z is now down.

OK, now for some simple mathematics:  The cross product of two vectors
yields another that is at right-angle to both original vectors (unless
both original vectors are coincident).  The cross product in MAX follows
the right-hand rule, which means that X cross Y yields Z, Y cross Z yields
Z, and Z cross X yields Y.  Baer this in mind when examining
calculateLookatMatrix() (examined further down).

Also, he length of the result of the cross-product is related to how close
to being at right-angles the original two vectors are.  Assuming the
original two vectors are unit length (that is one unit long):  If the
original vectors are at right angles, the cross product will be one unit
long.  If the original vectors are coincident, the cross product will be
zero units long (this is because you can't find a -single- vector that is
at right angles to two coincident vectors, there are an infinite number
of them). 

The act of converting a vector to a unit vector (ie: a vector of length
one) is referred to as "normalizing" the vector, hence MAX provides the
normalize() function to do this.


Now for the analysis of calculateLookatMatrix():

function calculateLookatMatrix orientation origin target up:[0,0,1] =
(
  local lookatmatrix = matrix3 1
  lookatmatrix.row1 = normalize(target-origin)
  lookatmatrix.row2 = normalize (cross up lookatmatrix.row1)
  lookatmatrix.row3 = normalize (cross lookatmatrix.row1 lookatmatrix.row2)
  lookatmatrix.row4 = origin
  orientation * lookatmatrix
)


Start with an identity matrix:

  local lookatmatrix = matrix3 1


We want the X axis of the result to coincide with a vector from the target
to the origin:

  lookatmatrix.row1 = normalize(target-origin)


We want the Z axis of the result to be as close to the specified "up"
vector as possible.  We achieve this by pretending that it is the Z axis,
and calculating a Y axis.  Note that this means that the Y axis will be at
right angle to the X axis and the initial up vector:

  lookatmatrix.row2 = normalize (cross up lookatmatrix.row1)


Chances are, the up vector wasn't at right angles to the initial lookat
vector (target-origin).  So, we generate a Z axis that is right angle to X
and Y.  This will create a "proper" transformation matrix, as all
axis vectors will be right angle to one another.  Note that this means
that the Z vector will be as close to the up vector as it can, but
constrained by the rule that it must be right angle to the X axis.  This
is what I refer to as the Z axis "tending toward" the up vector:

  lookatmatrix.row3 = normalize (cross lookatmatrix.row1 lookatmatrix.row2)


Now, we translate the matrix so that the resultant transformation is
relative to the position that was specified as the origin:

  lookatmatrix.row4 = origin


Now, we can perform a little magic that makes calculateLookatMatrix() much
more useful (I'll explain below):

  orientation * lookatmatrix


The last line there allows you to apply calculateLookatMatrix() to another
transformation matrix of some sort.  Normally, you would pass an identity
matrix as orientation.  This would produce a matrix that moves X to point
towards target and Z to tend towards up.  However, what if you wanted the
object's Y axis to point toward target, and its X axis to tend toward the
up vector?  To do this, you provide an orientation matrix to perform the
following transformation:

  * Y axis -> X axis
  * X axis -> Z axis

This means that the Y axis of the object becomes the X axis for the lookat
calculation, and the X axis of the object becomes the Z axis for the
lookat calculation, resulting in Y pointing at the target, and X tending
toward the up vector.  How do you generate this orientation matrix?
Remember what a matrix's 4 rows represent:

  * X axis' final orientation
  * Y axis' final orientation
  * Z axis' final orientation
  * origin's final location

With that in mind, you want your orientation matrix to contain:

  * Z vector (you want this axis to point along Z)
  * X vector (you want this axis to point along X)
  * ? vector (you want this axis right angle to X and Y)
  * [0,0,0]

To calculate the third row (Z result), perform a cross product of the
first and second.  The result is probably something like this (done in my
head, so you want to check the 3rd row :-) :

  * [0,0,1]
  * [1,0,0]
  * [0,1,0]
  * [0,0,0]

You feed this matrix into calculateLookatMatrix() as an orientation
matrix, and it will force Z to look at the target, and will tend Y toward
up.

It seems as though you might be able to use calculateLookatMatrix() as
follows:

  * Use the intersection of the ray and the surface as the origin.
  * Project a point along the normal from the origin, and use that
    as the target.
  * Use the direction you mean as "forward" for the up vector.
  * Finally, generate a matrix that transforms your object so that:
      * Whatever vector in that object should follow the surface normal
        ends up as the X axis.  This might be the object's Z axis?
      * Whatever vector in that object should face "forward" ends up
        as the Z axis.
    Use this matrix as the orientation matrix for calculateLookatMatrix().

This will calculate the transformation matrix of the object at a given
point in time.  Animating that is your next mission.  :-)

Hehe.  :-)  Hopefully this will help you somewhat.  Sorry for the delay,
but I've been rather busy of late...  :-/
