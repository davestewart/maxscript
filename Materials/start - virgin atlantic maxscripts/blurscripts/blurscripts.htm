<p><b><font color="#ffffff">LAST UPDATED:</font> NOV 13TH 2004</b>
</p>
<p>Welcome to BlurScripts, a collection of MAXScripts written
primarily for studio use, and available free to anyone who wants them.
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ffffff">The Disclaimers:</font></b>
</p>
<p>These scripts are provided as is, and Blur can not be held
responsible
for lost time, work or damage to your computer that results from usage
of these scripts. We can promise you they've been used at blur studio
in
production by a whole bunch of people and they all seem to work fine.
</p>
<p>If you wish to use a piece of this code in your own work, please
include
the original author's name in your script as a contributor.
For a more complete agreement, please read these <a
 href="http://www.blur.com/blurbeta/beta/template_offline/_contents/license.html">words
from our lawyers.</a>
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ffffff">Installation (<blink>READ CAREFULLY</blink>
or the scripts may not run properly):</font></b>
</p>
<p>Pick the script pack for the version of max you're running.
</p>
<p>Although there's a large list of available scripts, you will notice
there is only a single downloadable file, BSPack_rx_v0xx.zip. A lot of
the
BlurScripts rely on each other to function properly, and I just don't
have
time to break up each script into its own little zip, so I'm releasing
script updates in Pack form. All you have
to do is download the zip, then extract then into your 3dsmax root
directory,
for example, c:\3dsmax, make sure you have recurse subdirectories on.
The zip will
then install a bunch of files and directories, here's a short list of
what
it will install assuming your max root directory is c:\3dsmax
</p>
<ul>
  <li>c:\3dsmax\scripts\BlurScripts: This will contain all the scripts
themselves.</li>
  <li>c:\3dsmax\scripts\BlurMats: A series of materials required by
many scripts.</li>
  <li>c:\3dsmax\scripts\startup: 1 file will be added to this
directory, BSStartup.
Loads scripted plugins.</li>
  <li>c:\3dsmax\ui\icons: Adds 4 icon images, which are the icons for
the macroscript
versions of the blurscripts.</li>
  <li>c:\3dsmax\ui\macroscripts: 1 file is added called
BlurScripts.mcr. The file
is a set of pointers to the scripts\blurscripts directory. IE, if you
delete
the blurscripts directory, this macroscript file will not be able to
find
any of the scripts, and all your blurscript icons will not work.</li>
</ul>
To uninstall the blurscript pack, just delete all the files mentioned
above.
To install a new updated pack, just download the new zip and unzip them
again into your 3dsmax directory, saying overwrite current files. Feel
free to install only certain scripts if you wish, but do so at your own
risk, and don't ask us how to go about doing it. Packs are a complete
install,
so there's no need to download all the Packs, just the most recent one.
To actually use these scripts in the max interface, please consult your
3dsmax manual, all scripts can be run either through the maxscript run
script menu at the top of the screen, or by customizing your toolbars,
keyboard or quadmenu in Customize, Customize User Interface. The
category
name is BlurScripts.
<p>Lastly, some of these scripts require a few third party plugins in
order
to work. To have everything work properly, please install the required
plugins listed in the table below. If you don't, most of the scripts
will
still run, but a few won't.
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ffffff">Trouble Shooting:</font></b>
</p>
<p>If you're getting errors when starting these scripts, please try
answering
the following questions...
</p>
<p>1) Are all the scripts in the directories listed above?
<br>
2) Have all scripts listed in the Files To Delete section below been
deleted?
<br>
3) Go to configure paths, is your default script directory
maxroot\scripts?
<br>
4) Is your default scripts startup directory maxroot\scripts\startup?
<br>
5) Did you install the blurpack appropriate for the version of max I'm
running?
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ffffff">Files To Delete:</font></b>
</p>
<p>If you've installed previous BSPacks, and are now installing a new
one, you
may wish to check to make sure all of the following previous BlurScript
files
have been deleted (all assuming your 3dsmax directory is c:\3dsmax)...

objects
stage, wasting render time. This wasted time can become tremendous when
you have a really large environment, as in when you're doing tunnel
blast
scenes for ride films. So, what you do is create a box that follows
your
camera, everything inside this box at a given frame will be given a
visibility
track with a value of 1, everything outside the box will be given a
visibility
track with a value of 0, so now objects are only visible if it's near

similar
to the "Show Map In Viewport" function, except it works with
